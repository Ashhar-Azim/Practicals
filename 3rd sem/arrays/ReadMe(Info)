 

an array, is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements, each identified by at least one array index or key.
 An array is stored such that the position of each element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical formula.
most of the cases need to store a large amount of data of similar type. To store such a huge amount of data, we need to define numerous variables. 
It would be very tough to memorize all variable names while writing the programs. Instead, it is better to define an array and store all the elements into it.


**Advantages of Array –**

 Arrays represent multiple data elements of the same type using a single name.
In an array, accessing or searching an element is easy by using the index number.
 An array can be traversed easily just by incrementing the index by 1.
Arrays allocate memory in contiguous memory locations for all its data elements.


**Types of indexing in Array-**

· 0 (Zero Based Indexing) –  The first element of array refers to index 0.
· 1 (One Based Indexing) –  The first element of array refers to index 1.
· n (n Based Indexing) – The base index of an array can be chosen as per requirement.


**Accessing Elements in an Array –** 
To access any element of an array we need the following details:

Base Address of array.
Size of an element in bytes.
Which type of indexing, array follows.
Address of any element of a 1D array can be calculated by using the below given formula:

Byte address of an element A[i] = base address + size * (i – first index)


**2D Array– Defined**
2 Dimensional array are often defined as an array of arrays. A 2D array is also called a matrix. A matrix can be depicted as  a table of rows and columns.

How to declare 2D Array?
The syntax of declaring a 2D array is very much similar to that of an 1D array.

Syntax – 

int arr[max_rows][max_columns];


**How to access data in a 2D array?**
As in a one dimensional array, data can be accessed by using only an index, 
similarly in a two dimensional array we can access the cells individually by using the indices of the cells.
There are two indices attached to a single cell, one is its row number and the other one is its column number.

Syntax to store the value stored in any particular cell of an array – 

int x = a[i][j];


**Initializing 2D array –** 
When we declare a one dimensional array, 
there’s no need to specify the size of the array but it’s not the same for a two dimensional array. 
For a 2D array, we need to specify at least the row size i.e the second dimension.

Syntax to declare 2D array – 

int arr[2][2] = {1,2,3,4}

The number of elements present in a 2D array will always be equal to (number of rows * number of columns).


Here i and j are the row and column indices respectively.
